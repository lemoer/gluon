"Here you can configure your node to obtain SSL certificates using the Let'sEncrypt certificate "
"authority. Please make sure that you configure the dns record appropriately after the node "
"has rebooted to normal mode. You will find the ip address on the status page of the node. "
"The node will obtain a staging certificate first and then a production certificate once "
"the staging certificate is obtained successfully. This way we can ensure a reasonable "
"retry interval of 2 minutes. By enabling this, you agree to to the terms of service of "
"Let's Encrypt."
